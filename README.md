# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe

My final project for the Winter 2024 Introduction to Quantum Computing course. Our aim is to introduce quantum concepts to a non-technical young audience.

This works like normal tic-tac-toe, except you can place basic quantum gates that change the superposition and state of pieces on the board, or can set them like traps to modify future pieces placed there.
