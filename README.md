# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe

My final project for the Winter 2024 Introduction to Quantum Computing course. Our aim is to introduce quantum concepts to a non-technical young audience.

This works like normal tic-tac-toe, except you can place basic quantum gates that change the superposition and state of pieces on the board, or can set them like traps to modify future pieces placed there.

The most quote-unquote impressive technical aspect of this game is its backend is coded in Python, but it's hosted entirely within your own browser and the Github Pages framework. Pyodide is a really strange library.
